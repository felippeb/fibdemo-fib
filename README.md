# fibdemo-fib

This project contains the fibapi flask app, fibgen python module, and various scripts.

###bin

Original scratchings at the problem. One in bash, something I knew how to do already. I reworked that in python.

###fibgen

fibgen.py from /bin rewritten as as python module. Includes setup and nosetests.

###fibapi

Flask api app wrapper for fibgen.py. Presents json list from num input.
